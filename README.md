# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn

The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.

we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function. Then we will discuss the training set and validation set created this time from a series of images.
